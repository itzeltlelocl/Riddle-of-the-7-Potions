"Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, <br />
Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, <br />
One among us seven will let you move ahead, <br />
Another will transport the drinker back instead, <br />
Two among our number hold only nettle wine, <br />
Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. <br />
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, <br />
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: <br />
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide <br />
You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; <br />
Second, different are those who stand at either end, <br />
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; <br />
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, <br />
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; <br />
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right <br />
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight."
